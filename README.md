## eISCPGateway
The eISCP Gateway is a slimmed down version of the [eISCP Intermediary](https://github.com/thaddeusbond/eiscp-intermediary). The purpose of slimming it down is to provide an ultra-simple way to connect this service, running on something like an EC2 instance or VPS, to one eISCP enabled device. Clients will then have a simple and global gateway to the device, bypassing the need for 24/7 uptime on a local control machine.
